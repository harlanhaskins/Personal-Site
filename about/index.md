Hi, I'm Harlan Haskins, and I'm a Software Engineer in Mountain View, CA.

I currently work on Augmented Reality at Apple, and I previously worked on
the Swift compiler team and the HomeKit team.

I graduated from [RIT](http://www.rit.edu) in 2018 with a Bachelor's 
degree in Computer Science and a focus on languages and developer
tooling. I'm a member of
[Computer Science House](http://csh.rit.edu).

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/harlanhaskins) and on
