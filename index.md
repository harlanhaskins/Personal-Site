Hi, I'm Harlan Haskins, and I'm a Software Engineer in New York.

I currently work at [Typo*](https://typo.inc) as the engineering lead.

I previously worked on SwiftUI and UIKit for visionOS at Apple, and before that
I worked on the Swift compiler team and the HomeKit team.

I graduated from [RIT](http://www.rit.edu) in 2018 with a Bachelor's 
degree in Computer Science and a focus on languages and developer
tooling. I'm a member of
[Computer Science House](http://csh.rit.edu).

You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/harlanhaskins.com) and on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/harlanhaskins). My resume is available 
[here.]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/Resume.pdf)
